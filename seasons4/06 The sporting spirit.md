# The sporting spirit 体育的精神

I am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates goodwill between the nations, and that if only the common peoples of the world could meet one another at football or cricket, they would have no inclination to meet on the battlefield. Even if one didn't know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to orgies of hatred, one could deduce it from general principles.

Nearly all the sports practised nowadays are competitive. You play to win, and the game has little meaning unless you do your utmost to win. On the village green, where you pick up sides and no feeling of local patriotism is involved, it is possible to play simply for the fun and exercise: but as soon as the question of prestige arises, as soon as you feel that you and some larger unit will be disgraced if you lose, the most savage combative instincts are aroused. Anyone who has played even in a school football match knows this. At the international level, sport is frankly mimic warfare. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests, and seriously believe -- at any rate for short periods -- that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue.

当我听人们说体育运动可建立国家之间的友谊，还说各国民众若在足球场或板球场上交锋，就不愿在战场上残杀的时候，我总是惊讶不已。一个人即使不能从具体的事例（例如1936年的奥林匹克运动会）了解到国际运动比赛会导致疯狂的仇恨，也可以从常理中推断出结论。

现在开展的体育运动几乎都是竞争性的。参加比赛就是为了赢，如果不拼命去赢，那比赛就失了意义。在乡下的草坪上，然后你随便组成几个队，并且不涉及任何地方爱国主义时，那才可能是单纯的为了娱乐和锻炼而进行的比赛。一旦涉及到荣誉问题，一旦你感到如果你输了会让大家因此而蒙羞，那野蛮好斗的本能就会被激发。任何一个，只是在学校参加过足球比赛的人都知道这事儿。坦白说，在国际水平的比赛中运动是在模拟战争。值得关注的反而不是运动员的行为，而是观众的态度，以及观众身后各个国家的态度，他们甚至会把愤怒发泄到这些荒缪的比赛当中，而且非常确信 —— 至少在短期内 —— 那些跑跑、跳跳，踢踢球可以检测国民素质。
