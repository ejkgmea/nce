# Bats 蝙蝠

Not all sounds made by animals serve as language, and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role.

To get a full appreciation of what this means we must turn first to some recent human inventions. Everyone knows that if he shouts in the vicinity of a wall or a mountainside, an echo will come back. The further off this solid obstruction, the longer time will elapse for the return of the echo. A sound made by tapping on the hull of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes, the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated. So was born the echo-sounding apparatus, now in general use in ships. Every solid object will reflect a sound, varying according to the size and nature of the object. A shoal of fish will do this. So it is a comparatively simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish. With experience, and with improved apparatus, it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but to tell if it is herring, cod, or other well-known fish, by the pattern of its echo.

It has been found that certain bats emit squeaks and by receiving the echoes, they can locate and steer clear of obstacles -- or locate flying insects on which they feed. This echo-location in bats is often compared with radar, the principle of which is similar.

动物发出声音不全是为了对话。我们只需要借助一个很不寻常的发现，蝙蝠运用回声音定位的例子，它能通过回声来确定哪些东西有实用价值。

要透彻理解这句话的涵义，我们应先回顾一下人类最近的几项发明。大家都知道，在墙壁或山腰附近发出的喊声，就会听到回声。作为反弹的那个实体障碍物离你越远，回声回来的所花的时候就越久。敲打船体所发了的声音会从海底传回来，测出回声间隔的时间，便可算出该处海洋的深度。任何固体对象反射声音，都会根据物体的大小和性质而发生变化。鱼群也可以反射声音。所以，测量海底定位鱼群这些测量都挺简单的。根据经验和改进后的仪器，不仅能够确定鱼群的位置，而且可以根据鱼群回声的特点分辨出是鲱鱼、鳕鱼，或是人们所熟悉的其他鱼类。

人们发现，某些蝙蝠能发出尖叫声，并能通过回声来确定并躲开障碍物，或找到它们赖以为生的昆虫。蝙蝠这种回声定位常常和雷达相放一起比较，其原理是相似的。
