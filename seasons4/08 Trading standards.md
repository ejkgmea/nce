# Trading standards 贸易标准

Chickens slaughtered in the United States, claim officials in Brussels, are not fit to grace European tables. No, say the Americans: our fowl are fine, we simply clean them in a different way. These days, it is differences in national regulations, far more than tariffs, that put sand in the wheels of trade between rich countries. It is not just farmers who are complaining. An electric razor that meets the European Union's safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States, and an American-made dialysis machine needs the EU's okay before it hits the market in Europe.

As it happens, a razor that is safe in Europe is unlikely to electrocute Americans. So, ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, why have two lots of tests where one would do? Politicians agree, in principle, so America and the EU have been trying to reach a deal which would eliminate the need to double-test many products. They hope to finish in time for a trade summit between America and the EU on May 28th. Although negotiators are optimistic, the details are complex enough that they may be hard-pressed to get a deal at all. 

Why? One difficulty is to construct the agreements. The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devices and then hammer out different pacts covering, say, electronic goods and drug manufacturing. The EU -- following fine continental traditions -- wants agreement on general principles, which could be applied to many types of products and perhaps extended to other countries.

自称是 Brussels 的官员说，美屠宰的鸡放在欧洲的餐桌上不优雅。美国人说：不，我们的家禽很好的，我们只是用了另一种清洗方式。当前，因为各国规则不一样，而不是关税过高阻碍了发达国家之间的贸易。不仅仅是农民在抱怨。一把符合欧盟的安全标准的电动剃须刀必须得到美国测试人员的批准才能在美国市场上销售，而美国制造的透析仪也要得到欧盟的同意才能进入欧洲市场。

碰巧一把在欧洲能安全使用的剃须刀不大可能使美国人触电受伤。所以，大西洋两岸的企业都在问，为什么需要搞两套测试标准，一套不行吗？政治家在原则上同意了， 因此，美国和欧洲一直在尝试达成协议，以便为许多产品取消双重检查。他们希望尽早达成协议，为 5 月 28 号美国和欧洲的贸易峰会做准备。虽然谈判代表持乐观态度，但协议细节足够复杂到很可能使他们无法取得一致。

为什么呢？光是起草这份协议就很麻烦，怎么达到意见一致。美国人倒是很乐意就医疗器械的标准达成一个协议，然后推敲出不同的条约，用以涵盖 —— 比如说 —— 电子产品和药品的量产。欧洲人遵循优良的大陆传统，希望有个通用的规则，因为这些规则可以适用于许多不同类型的产品，或许还能延伸到其它国家。
