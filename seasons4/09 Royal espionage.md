# Royal espionage 王室谍报活动

Alfred the Great acted as his own spy, visiting Danish camps disguised as a minstrel. In those days wandering minstrels were welcome everywhere. They were not fighting men, and their harp was their passport. Alfred had learned many of their ballads in his youth, and could vary his programme with acrobatic tricks and simple conjuring.

While Alfred's little army slowly began to gather at Athelney, the king himself set out to penetrate the camp of Guthrum, the commander of the Danish invaders. These had settled down for the winter at Chippenham: thither Alfred went. He noticed at once that discipline was slack: the Danes had the self-confidence of conquerors, and their security precautions were casual. They lived well, on the proceeds of raids on neighbouring regions. There they collected women as well as food and drink, and a life of ease had made them soft. 

Alfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athelney. The force there assembled was trivial compared with the Danish horde. But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer fit for prolonged battle: and that their commissariat had no organization, but depended on irregular raids.

So, faced with the Danish advance, Alfred did not risk open battle but harried the enemy. He was constantly on the move, drawing the Danes after him. His patrols halted the raiding parties: hunger assailed the Danish army. Now Alfred began a long series of skirmishes -- and within a month the Danes had surrendered. The episode could reasonably serve as a unique epic of royal espionage!

Alfred the Great 曾亲自充当自己的间谍，他扮演巡演歌手到丹麦军营里侦察。当时，浪迹天涯的巡演歌手受到很多地方的欢迎。他们不是作战人员，竖琴就是他们的通行证。Alfred 年轻的时候学了很多丹麦人的民谣，他还可在自己的节目当中穿插一些杂技和小魔术。

当 Alfred 所在的小部队开始在 Athelney 慢慢聚集的时候，国王已经潜入了丹麦入侵者 司令官 Guthrum 的营地。 他们已经在 Chippenham 驻扎下来准备过冬，所以 Alfred 才去了那里。他立马发现军队纪律松弛：他们对征服者充满信心，然后他们自己的安全措施缺很随便，马马虎虎。他们住下之后，还会继续突袭附近的地区。他们不仅搜刮吃喝，还掠夺妇女，这样的生活容易让他们变得软弱无力。

Alfred 在那里待了一个礼拜后就回 Athelney 了。他召集的那点兵力跟丹麦那一大群人比起来有点微不足道。但是 Alfred 推断丹麦人不适合打持久战：他们的军饷处于无组织无纪律状态，只能依赖各种掠夺来维持。

因此，面对丹麦人的进攻，Alfred 没有冒着风险同他们正面战斗但敌人穷追不舍。他不断的移动，引诱着丹麦人在后面。他派出巡逻队去阻止对方抢掠：让饥饿去攻击丹麦的军队。这个时候 Alfred 开始发起一长串小规模的战斗 —— 不到一个月的时间，丹麦人就投降了。这足以充当一个独一无二的史诗级别王室间谍活动事件了。
