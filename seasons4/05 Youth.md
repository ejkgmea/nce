# Youth 青年

People are always talking about 'the problem of youth'. If there is one -- which I take leave to doubt -- then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves. Let us get down to fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings -- people just like their elders. There is only one difference between an old man and a young one: the young man has a glorious future before him and the old one has a splendid future behind him: and maybe that is where the rub is.

When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and uncertain -- that I was a new boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking.

I find young people exciting. They have an air of freedom, and they have not a dreary commitment to mean ambitions or love of comfort. They are not anxious social climbers, and they have no devotion to material things. All this seems to me to link them with life, and the origins of things. It's as if they were, in some sense, cosmic beings in violent and lovely contrast with us suburban creatures. All that is in my mind when I meet a young person. He may be conceited, ill-mannered, presumptuous or fatuous, but I do not turn for protection to dreary cliches about respect for elders -- as if mere age were a reason for respect. I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong.

人们总是在谈论那些“青年人问题“。如果存一个这样的问题 —— 我对此表示怀疑 —— 那这个问题应该是老年人造成的而不是青年人。让我们一起来研究一些基本事实并承认：毕竟所有的年轻人跟他们的长辈一样也是人。老年人和青年人只有一个区别：青年人有光辉灿烂的前景，而老年人的辉煌已成为过去：可能问题就是在这里发生了磨擦。

我年轻的时候，当时还是一个刚进大学的小伙子，我总觉得自己好年轻，有些事情拿不准，如果当初我要把这当成是一个问题来看待的话我应该会很感兴趣。至少这个事儿，会得到某些承认，这正是年人所热于追求的。

我觉得年轻人有活力。他们无拘无束，他们既不追逐卑鄙的名利，也不贪图生活的舒适。他们不喜欢在社会上摸爬滚打，也不一味追求物质享受。这一切事情让我把他们的生活和世间万物之源联系在了一起。他们似乎是宇宙人，同我们这些乡巴佬形成了强烈而鲜明的对照。每当我遇见一个年轻人我就会想。他可能狂妄自负，举止无理，傲慢放肆，愚昧无知，但我不会用应当尊重长辈这一套无聊的陈词滥调来为我自己辨护，似乎年长就是受人尊敬的理由。认为我和他们是平等的。如果我认为他们错了，我就以平等的身份和他们争个明白。
